      <description>I had a problem yesterday getting my Ubuntu netbook (which is a Dell Inspiron 910 mini) to see my Nook.
After, mucking about with various unix commands, including:
mount lsusb dmesg | egrep -i connected ls /dev/sd*  It turns out that Ubuntu couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the Nook because the power was too low.
It seems that there was enough power to power the Nook on, but not enough for it to make itself visible to the netbook.</description>
