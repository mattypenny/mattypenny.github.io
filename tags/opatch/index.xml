      <description>Got the following error:
C:\oracle\ora92\OPatch&amp;gt;perl opatch.pl versionPerl lib version (v5.8.3) doesn&#39;t match executable version (v5.6.1) at x:/oracle/10.2.0/perl/5.8.3/lib/MSWin32-x86-multi-thread/Config.pm line 32.Compilation failed in require at x:/oracle/10.2.0/perl/5.8.3/lib/MSWin32-x86-multi-thread/lib.pm line 6.BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at x:/oracle/10.2.0/perl/5.8.3/lib/MSWin32-x86-multi-thread/lib.pm line 6.Compilation failed in require at opatch.pl line 88.BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at opatch.pl line 88. Kind of obvious, but the fix here is to set your PERL5LIB variable correctly&amp;hellip;

      <description>opatch failed with the above error.
Again its really a problem with the wetware (i.e. me), but worth typing up as its fairly obscure.
The problem seems to have been that I was logged in as a different user on the server which holds our staging area when I copied the software across. I mapped the drive on the the target server as the Oracle user, but it still seems to have inherited the wrong ownership at some level.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having problems with opatch.
todo - fix the link Setting ACTIVE_STATE_PERL=TRUE cured at least one of these (although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I didn&amp;rsquo;t patch at least once without the setting, because there was another version of perl - mksnt - on the server) as per the previous post
Its sometimes failed, then worked without me being entirely sure what I changed in the meantime.
Last night I sussed that at least some of this is caused by having a space following the ACTIVE_STATE_PERL=TRUE</description>
